# jupyterlab_practice

This Git repo is for Assignment 7 of the Data Science Toolkit course. For this assignment we performed the following:

1. Created a new repo named jupyterlab_practice
2. Cloned this repo locally
3. Created a new branch to work on, named developer-1
4. Created an environment called environment.yaml, so that things will be portable.

We then answered some questions in assignment_07.ipynb, created 2 new jupyter notebooks to answer some questions. I was also sure to commit changes to the local repo and push them to the repo often. Finally, after a final push of commits, the new branch (developer-1) was merged with the main branch of the repo. Fun stuff!
